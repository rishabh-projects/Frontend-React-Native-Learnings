Styling React Native Applications
Mobile devices are what many users use to browse the web, but developing apps that simultaneously work on Android, iOS, and in web browsers can be an expensive, time-consuming, and baffling process. In this course, Styling React Native Applications, you’ll learn to style React Native applications, resulting in a consistent and professional appearance on multiple different mobile platforms, with only one code base. First, you’ll see how to apply basic styling to your React Native application using the Stylesheet.Create() method and applying fixed dimensions and positioning to the elements of the page, creating simple and consistent, though inflexible, basic layouts. Next, you’ll discover how to create more robust and dynamic layouts by using Flex styling instead of fixed dimensions, enabling you to create a wider variety of layouts including vertically and horizontally arranged sections, as well as elements that automatically resize to fit the context. Finally, you’ll explore how to animate your application using the LayoutAnimation API, creating fluid transitions between application views and the states within each view. The animation skills you'll learn will enable you to create engaging and interactive applications on all platforms. When you’re finished with this course, you’ll have the skills and knowledge of styling React Native applications to confidently and independently apply robust styles to any application you are assigned to work on, or to build your own applications easily and with minimal code.
