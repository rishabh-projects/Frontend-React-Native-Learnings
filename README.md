## Building Mobile Applications React Native

React Native is an open-source mobile application framework used to develop apps for Android, Apple, and Windows platforms; and for the web. Develop native apps for Android and iOS using React and JavaScript to create a single codebase that can be shared across platforms. React Native also lets you iterate quickly - allowing you to see your changes as soon as you save.


#### React Native Fundamentals
React Native is quickly becoming the preferred hybrid mobile app platform. Here we learn essentials of React Native including creating components, using props and state, and making use of data from remote sources.

#### React Native: Getting Started
JavaScript has become a valid option for mobile development. Here you’ll learn to build a mobile app with the built in tools. First, you’ll explore how to create a component. Next, you’ll discover routing and how to navigate between views. Finally, you’ll learn how to use state to manage data that will change. When you’re finished with this assignment, you’ll have the skills and knowledge of React Native needed to build your own mobile app.
###### Setting up React Native
###### Creating Your First Component
###### Routing Between Components
###### Creating a Form Component
###### Retrieving Remote Data Using the Fetch API
###### Generating a Build of the App


#### Building Mobile Apps with React Native
Mobile applications need to provide a rich and engaging experience to attract and keep users. Here you’ll learn to develop mobile apps with more advanced navigation, multi-touch gestures, and Web API access. First, you’ll explore how to set up React Native to work with the Android Emulator and iOS Simulator. Next, you’ll discover how to implement navigation and data passing among screens and handle multi-touch gestures in a mobile user interface. Finally, you’ll learn how to request and process data from a remote web service using the XMLHttpRequest API. When you’re finished with this assignment, you’ll have the skills and knowledge of React Native needed to create richer, more engaging mobile applications for both iOS and Android.
###### Using the Android Emulator and iOS Simulator with React Native
###### Implement React Native Navigation and Routes
###### Utilize Gestures
###### Access Web APIs with XMLHttpRequest


#### Building React Native Applications Using Expo
Normally when building mobile apps using JavaScript extensive configuration is required. With React Native we have the option of using Expo to make the process easier. Here you’ll learn to develop and generate mobile apps using Expo. First, you’ll explore what Expo is, how to install it, and how to generate a project. Next, you’ll discover how to build apps using React Native components and the Expo SDK. Finally, you’ll learn how to configure your app to be built using the Expo CLI. When you’re finished with this assignment , you’ll have the skills and knowledge of React native and Expo needed to create your own apps ready for release to the respective app store.

#### Building a Chat Application with React Native
React Native enables you to create mobile apps that run cross-platform: on both Android and iOS. Here you’ll learn to build a chat application from start to finish. First, you’ll see how to set up a dev environment. Next, you’ll discover how to work with React Native’s built-in components and work with animations. Finally, you’ll learn how to connect to a server using a websocket connection. When you’re finished with this assignment, you’ll have the skills and knowledge of building applications with React Native needed to create cross-platform mobile applications efficiently.
###### Setting up the Development Environment
###### Adding Components, Hooks, and Animations
###### Communicating Using WebSockets


#### React Native 0.63: Components Playbook
React Native builds native cross-platform apps using JavaScript and React. Here you’ll learn to build scalable React Native apps using the core components. First, you’ll explore building the views in the app with the ScrollView component. Next, you’ll learn more about other components like FlatList and SectionList to display large lists. Then, you'll build custom components for your app which can be reused across the app. Finally, you’ll learn about the TextInput component to allow the user to enter data. When you’re finished with this assignment, you’ll have the skills and knowledge to build React Native applications using some of its core components.
###### Setting up React Native Development Environments
###### Displaying Scrollable Lists with ScrollView Component
###### Rendering Large Lists with FlatList Component
###### Displaying Large Lists by Section Using SectionList Component
###### Developing Reusable Custom Components
###### Configuring User Inputs with TextInput Component


#### Styling React Native Applications
Mobile devices are what many users use to browse the web, but developing apps that simultaneously work on Android, iOS, and in web browsers can be an expensive, time-consuming, and baffling process. Here, you’ll learn to style React Native applications, resulting in a consistent and professional appearance on multiple different mobile platforms, with only one code base. First, you’ll see how to apply basic styling to your React Native application using the Stylesheet.Create() method and applying fixed dimensions and positioning to the elements of the page, creating simple and consistent, though inflexible, basic layouts. Next, you’ll discover how to create more robust and dynamic layouts by using Flex styling instead of fixed dimensions, enabling you to create a wider variety of layouts including vertically and horizontally arranged sections, as well as elements that automatically resize to fit the context. Finally, you’ll explore how to animate your application using the LayoutAnimation API, creating fluid transitions between application views and the states within each view. The animation skills you'll learn will enable you to create engaging and interactive applications on all platforms. When you’re finished with this assignment, you’ll have the skills and knowledge of styling React Native applications to confidently and independently apply robust styles to any application you are assigned to work on, or to build your own applications easily and with minimal code

###### Animating React Native Components with the LayoutAnimation API


#### Testing Mobile Apps in React Native
React Native mobile testing systems allow developers to thoroughly test apps for bugs to ensure a quality user experience. Here, you’ll learn how to find and fix errors and bugs in the React Native framework. First, you’ll explore the different kinds of testing available to React developers. Next, you’ll discover how to test components using the React Native Testing Library. Finally, you’ll learn how to complete end-to-end tests with Detox. When you’re finished with this assignment, you’ll have the skills and knowledge of React Native testing needed to produce and test quality React Native apps.
